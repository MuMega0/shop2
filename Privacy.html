            At Nordstrom our customers are at the heart of what we do; we want to provide our customers with products
            and services that help each customer feel good and look their best, and this extends to our customers having

            Within this policy, we will refer to the Websites, Apps, in-store activities, and communications with us
            collectively as the “Services”. The goal of this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is to explain how Nordstrom,

            This Policy applies to Nordstrom Services, and any sites, mobile apps or products that display or link to
            this Policy. It does not apply to any website, mobile app, service, or product that does not display or link
            to this Policy or that contains  <br> its own privacy policy. If you are the holder of a Nordstrom branded credit
            or debit card, please also review the Nordstrom Debit Card Privacy Notice and Nordstrom Credit Card Privacy
            Notice for more information about how Nordstrom Card Services and our banking partner use personal
            information associated with your Nordstrom branded credit or debit card.

            information with us. By sharing your  <br> personal information with us, including in a store, by reaching out to
            us by email or postal mail, or by accessing or using our Websites and Apps, you agree to our use of your

            How we collect personal information

            We collect personal information in various ways, both directly and indirectly. For example, when you send us
            postal mail, email our customer care team, fill out a form on our Websites, place an order through the
            Websites or Apps, or provide information to one of our in-store team members, we collect your information
            directly. We may also collect your personal information indirectly through automated means, for example,
            when you interact with our Websites or use our Apps, we may use technologies to collect information about
            how you use the Websites or Apps. We may also receive information about you from third parties including
            from our affiliates and subsidiaries, social media platforms or from our advertising partners.

            We collect personal information when you provide it

            We may collect personal information directly from you or your device as follows:

            When you register for a Nordstrom account, it is necessary for you to provide personal information that
            includes your name and email address. You may choose to provide us with additional personal information,
            including billing, mailing, and shipping addresses, phone number, and a payment method (e.g., credit card).
            If you make purchases through the Websites or Apps, you will also create a username and password,
            information that on subsequent visits helps us confirm your identity and makes it easier for you to make
            purchases on our Websites and Apps.
            If you join our Nordy Club, in addition to the Nordstrom account information you provide (as noted above),
            we will also need your mobile phone number.
            If you apply for a credit account or to manage an existing credit or debit account, you will need to provide
            your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. You will also need to provide other information
            needed to assess your credit worthiness and verify your identity, such as date of birth, social security
            number, income, and employer information. This information is necessary for us to process your application,
            manage your account, and provide you with credit-related services. Please note that if you choose to link
            your card to another third-party website, they may use your information in different ways and have privacy
            policies that differ from ours; please refer to their privacy policies to understand how they collect and
            handle your information and your choices. For additional information about use of your personal information
            associated with a Nordstrom credit account, please see Nordstrom Credit Card Privacy Notice and Nordstrom
            Debit Card Privacy Notice.
            When you shop with us, either through the Websites or App, we store your browsing history, what you searched
            for, including when you use our style personalization tools, what you have saved for later, and when you ask
            us to notify you about items that go on sale or come back in stock and what you bought (if you make a
            purchase).
            When you interact with Nordstrom, including with a member of our sales team, visit a store, contact our
            customer care team, participate in a contest or sweepstakes, respond to a survey, engage in a promotional
            activity, register to attend an event or appointment, or apply for employment (applicants have access to our
            Careers Privacy Policy which contains information on our collection and use of applicant and employee data).
            When you sign up to receive emails, including marketing communications.
            When you visit a store, we may collect video recordings and photographs of you that we use for security, to
            detect and prevent fraud, prevent product loss or damage, report incidents, and for operational purposes.
            We collect personal information from third-party sources

            To better understand your preferences, operate our business, and provide you with products and services we
            believe you will love, we may receive your personal information from the following third parties:

            Nordstrom, Inc. and the Nordstrom family of brands and companies you have interacted with.
            Online social networks if you follow Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Nordstrom Trunk Club, or any of our brands
            on social media sites, for example, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok or Pinterest. We may
            collect personal information when you communicate with us within the social media sites or use
            functionalities, plugins, widgets, or tools from social media platforms or networks in connection with our
            Websites (e.g., to log into an account, or to share inspiration, finds, purchases, and other content with
            your friends and followers on social media) or when you click “Share This” or “Like” buttons. We think it is
            important to point out that if you make a post on a social media site, such as on Facebook, Instagram, or
            Pinterest, or identify us in your social media feed by tagging us using a hashtag (#) or “at” (@), your
            personal information may be publicly available and is subject to the privacy policies of those social media
            sites. We recommend you review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit to understand the
            data collection and practices of those third parties.
            Third-party service providers that support our business, including companies that help with our marketing
            efforts, analytics providers, advertising networks and cooperatives, third parties that share information
            with us about the different devices you use online, and other third parties that we collaborate or work
            with.
            We collect personal information using automated technologies

            Personal information is also collected through automated technologies and shared with us when you visit our
            Website, use our Apps, open an email, or click on one of our advertisements.

            We automatically create website and mobile application log files, which are created when you access our
            Website and/or Apps. In addition, automated data collection technologies – such as cookies, beacons, tags,
            software development kits (SDK), and scripts – are used by us to analyze trends, administer the Websites and
            Apps, and track users’ movements around the Websites and Apps. We, and our third-party service providers,
            also use these technologies to gather demographic information about our user base as individuals and in the
            aggregate.

            A “cookie” is a small text file that is stored on an individual’s computer and downloaded to the computer or
            mobile device when they visit a website. Cookies then send information back to the originating website on
            each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that same cookie. We use the following types of
            cookies:

            Essential Cookies are required to make our Websites and Apps function properly and cannot be turned off in
            our systems. If you block these cookies, portions of our Websites or Apps may not function properly.
            Performance and Functional Cookies allow us to count visits and sources of traffic on our Websites and Apps
            so we can measure and improve performance and functionality. They help us know which pages of our Websites
            are most and least popular, which features of the Apps are used most, and how visitors move around the
            Websites and Apps.
            Targeted Advertising Cookies may be set through our Websites by our advertising partners. They may be used
            by advertising companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other
            websites.
            Social Media Cookies allow you to share information using social media sharing buttons on social networks
            like Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram, or Twitter. This information may then be used by the social
            media network to deliver targeted advertising to you.
            We may combine information collected automatically (as described above) from your interactions with our
            Services and your activity on third-party sites with other data (including personal information).

            If you wish to opt out of allowing certain cookies, you may do so by changing your browser settings so that
            cookies from our Websites and Apps cannot be set (see the “Interest-Based Advertising” in the “Your options”
            section below for your options). Please note that if you delete, block, or otherwise restrict cookies, or
            use a different computer or Internet browser, you will need to renew your cookie management choices.
